Burkhart Triangle
-----------------
The "Burkhart Pyramid" is defined as a pyramid of numbers, that is built upside down.
  At the base of the triangle, it contains a number.  In this example weâ€™ll use 1.
  To construct levels beyond the base, add the number below and to the left with the
  number below and to the right. If the number is not present, assume it a 0.
These pyramids can be built with any number of levels, and any number at the base, so
  those must be configurable in your program.  Levels should be centered with the base
  as below.   For example, if I pass in a 1 for the base and 6 levels the pyramid would
  look like this:

1 5 10 10 5 1
  1 4 6 4 1
   1 3 3 1
    1 2 1
     1 1
      1
